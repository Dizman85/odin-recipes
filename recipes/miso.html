  <ul>
    <li>2 heads of garlic</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
    <li>6 cups water or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>3 to 4 tbsp. white miso, to taste</li>
    <li>4 cups kale, chopped</li>
    <li>pinch of red pepper flakes, optional</li>
    <li>squeeze of lemon, optional</li>
    <li>sliced green onions, optional</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
    <li>Remove the outmost layer from the garlic bulbs. Cut off the tops of the garlic bulbs before placing them on a piece of foil. The foil should be large enough to fold over and close tight at the top. Drizzle one tablespoon of olive oil over each bulb and close the tin foil by folding all the edges until theyâ€™re closed and the bulbs completely covered. Bake for 45-50 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once garlic bulbs have been baked, squeeze them into a large pot and mash with the back of a wooden spoon. Add liquids, turn heat to medium-low, and add miso, stirring to incorporate the paste. Add greens and let wilt until dark green, or about 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve with a slice of lemon, scallions, and pinch of red pepper flakes.git</li>
