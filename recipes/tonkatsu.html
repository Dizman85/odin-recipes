    <p> Tonkatsu, or pork cutlet, is a Japanese dish of pork filet that is breaded with panko breadcrumbs and deep-fried. It is traditionally served with a dark, savory tonkatsu sauce and shredded green cabbage.

        Pork tonkatsu is often found on the menus of Japanese restaurants and is also a very popular bento (boxed lunch) item. It is also a popular ingredient in katsu donburi (donburi is a one-dish meal of ingredients served over rice), which is tonkatsu served with cooked egg and a savory-sweet sauce.

        <li>Coat pork with panko breadcrumbs and set aside on a platter.</li>
        <li>In a deep pan, heat the canola oil to around 340 F as measured on a frying thermometer.</li>
        <li>Deep-fry breaded pork for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn pork over and fry about 5 more minutes or until cooked through and browned.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>While pork is resting, finely shred green cabbage and soak in ice-cold water.</li>
